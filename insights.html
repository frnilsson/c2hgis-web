                                        <p>Because consumers rely on many different types of resources to manage their health and everyday lives, and as the focus broadens to include population health, it is becoming clear that future healthcare systems will not be confined to hospitals, nor will health services only be provided by physicians. Rather, through broadband-based tools clinicians, social services providers, pharmacies, grocery stores, and fitness centers, for example, can work collaboratively and seamlessly with each other (as well as with consumers and caregivers) to help individuals reduce disease, reach personal health goals, and otherwise optimize health outcomes – in a cohesive, interconnected health and care ecosystem.</p>
                                        <p>These collaborative health and care ecosystems will be enabled by broadband network infrastructure that facilitates the “on demand” sharing of electronic information, facilitates the provision of “e”-services, and supports interactive communication among patients, consumers, and others assisting with their care needs.

The curated maps provide a summary of our ongoing research, observations, and preliminary insights. Because Virginia’s story, like that of our nation, continues to emerge and evolve each day, neither the maps nor the insights derived from them provide an exact representation of the actual state of affairs in the Commonwealth. They do, however, provide a snapshot or high-level overview of Virginia's health connectivity story. We also present data in the form of interactive maps that you can mix, match, and explore to generate your own insights under the tab entitled "Explore the Maps in Detail."</p>
