                        <h2>Broadband Data</h2>
                        <p> 
                            Broadband has a wide impact on the daily lives of individuals and communities. Broadband as well is a nuanced construct, including upload and download speeds and functional characteristics like number of providers in an area, actual versus advertised speeds, among others.  

                            Broadband data also gives an idea of what can be enabled and delivered through the broadband ecosystem of network, devices, and applications. For example, if there isn't sufficient competition in a particular region then prices may not be affordable to enable the network benefits for all consumers; or if network integrity or uptime is not high or consistent then they types of applications that can be used and therefore the broadband benefits that can be delivered to every consumer would be limited. This has implications on remote and real time monitoring of data and the emerging field of IoT, cloud computing, and integrated systems for health for individuals and communities.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Health Data</h2>
                        <p>
                            To get a picture of health in the US, we used data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's County Health Rankings page, which is used widely by various agencies including local health departments to capture a baseline of population health and monitor its progression over time. A more extensive discussion on each of the measures shown below can be found on the RWJF website (see link above).
                        </p>
                        <h4>Population Health Outcomes:</h4>
                        <p>
                            The Obesity rate in a population represents a convergence of many clinical and non-clinical factors in a population. While the RWJF County Health Rankings considers obesity rate as a measure of 'health behavior', it can also be considered the outcome of multiple environmental, socio-economic, and clinical factors. In this case it's the outcome of many risk factors that could have been mitigated through primary prevention measures. In these maps obesity is defined as the percentage of the adult population that has a body mass index greater than or equal to 30. These data originally come from the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which in turn develops modeled estimates of county-level obesity rates using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a multi-dimensional construct that relates to physical, mental, emotional and social functioning. It tries to capture the impact of health status on a person's quality of life. The CDC defines HRQoL as “an individual’s or group’s perceived physical and mental health over time”. These data are represented in the maps as 'fair or poor health', 'physically unhealthy days', and 'mentally unhealthy days' defined as the percent of adults reporting poor or fair health and the average number of physically and mentally unhealthy days reported per month. These data originally come from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from the CDC.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Quality to Care:</h4>
                        <p>
                            'Preventable Hospital stays' and 'Diabetic Monitoring' are two metrics related to the quality of care that a population receives. Quality of care requires a multi-disciplinary and collaborative approach between patients, care-givers, clinicians, and many other parts of the community and health care system. Poor quality of care can lead to poor health outcomes. Quality of care is a major dimension of health delivery that can stand to benefit from broadband connectivity. 'Preventable Hospital Stays' is defined as the hospitalization rate for ambulatory-care sensitive conditions per 1,000 Medicare enrollee; 'Diabetic monitoring' measures the percentage of diabetic Medicare enrollees that receive HbA1c screening. Broadband connectivity can enable remote health monitoring; empower patients to monitor their own physiologic measures and share that data with care givers, health care system, and connected environments; and provide appropriate supports to allow individuals to engage in self-care within their communities.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Access to Care:</h4>
                        <p>
                            A population's ability to access quality care is related to better health outcomes. 'Access to care' means that physicians are present in the area, they are available, affordable, and the community has the means to pay for them (e.g. through insurance). To capture these measures, the RWJF acquired data from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which in turn compiles data from the American Medical Association Master file, the National Provider Identification file, and from Census Population Estimates program to report primary care physician and dentist data at the county level. Data for the mental health provider measure was acquired from the National Provider Identification file which uses the National Plan & Provider Enumeration system to list each unique provider. The number of people that were uninsured were defined as 'the percentage of the population younger than age 65 without health insurance'. The data for this measure comes from the Census Bureau’s Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE), which provide model-based estimates of health insurance coverage for all states and counties in the United States.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Socioeconomic Determinants:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Socioeconomic determinants 'reflect the social factors and physical conditions of the environment in which people are born, live, learn, play, work, and age. Also known as social and physical determinants of health, they impact a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes.' (<a href="http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/about/foundation-health-measures/Determinants-of-Health" target="new">www.healthypeople.gov/2020/about/foundation-health-measures/Determinants-of-Health</a>). Socioeconomic determinants like income are important because they permit access to health insurance and allow healthy lifestyle choices. Poorer families and individuals are more likely to live in unsafe and unhealthy environments, and have no or restricted healthy diet and exercise options. Consequently, adults in the highest income brackets are healthier than those in the middle class and will live, on average, more than six years longer than those with the lowest incomes; and mothers in low income brackets are more likely than those in higher income brackets to have pre-term or low birthweight babies. <sup>(<a href="#">1</a>,<a href="#">2</a>,<a href="#">3</a>)</sup> In general, poverty and income inequality have wide ranging impact on health, including risk of mortality. Connectivity has been identified as being a key factor in increasing access to many of the socioeconomic determinants of health. <sup>(<a href="#">4</a>,<a href="#">5</a>)</sup> Broadband has the potential to increase access to many of the socioeconomic determinants directly or indirectly through a broader ecosystem of connectivity. Two measures from RWJF's County Health Rankings have been included: Children in Poverty and Income Inequality. 'Children in Poverty' is defined as the percentage of children living in poverty, as defined by the federal poverty threshold and is derived by RWJF based on data from the Census’ Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE). 'Income Inequality' is the ratio of household income at the 80th percentile level with that at the 20th percentile from the American Community Survey.
