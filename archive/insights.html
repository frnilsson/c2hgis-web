Rather, through broadband-based tools clinicians, social services providers, pharmacies, grocery stores, and fitness centers, for example, can work collaboratively and seamlessly with each other (as well as with consumers and caregivers) to help individuals reduce disease, reach personal health goals, and otherwise optimize health outcomes – in a cohesive, interconnected health and care ecosystem.</p>
